<h3><img src="images/ill_title.jpg" alt="ill title" width="63" height="20" />Game Description</h3>
<a name="GD"></a> 
<p> <br>The purpose of this game is to complete goals which bring you points. In your aid will come upgrades that are applicable to your trains, such as speed doubling, teleportation from a station to another and doubling of points for that specific goal.

<p /br>

The game is turn based, which means that you also have a little bit of time to think about further tactical moves and to view some of the opponent's information, so that you consider all your options.

/>Selling Points</h3>
<p> <br>Our game is coded in a nice and neat way, following the Agile software development process, with a high degree of modularity and code readability. It has been refactored throughout the development and testing phases, so we bring forward the best version of it. Redundancy has been reviewed, so the code is minimal for the implementation of the game.
</p>

Moreover, we know that a game must be consistent and appealing to customers, so, for the next part of this SEPR project, we provide 100% access to our designer that will create your icons for upgrades and trains to match our initial ones, so you will not have to bother with it.

<p>
The game is functional and respects and implements the requirements set for this part of the project, so it only needs upgraded, and not improved in any way.
</p>

/>User Manual</h3>
At the start of the game each player will be given one goal to send a train from one location to another for a certain number of points. The longer the distance between the locations of a goal, the more points that will be awarded when the goal is completed. They can then choose a route for a train to travel from this starting location to the given end location. The aim of the game is to get more points than your opponent by completing goals using a combination of luck and tactics. Trains can be given better engines and upgrades (explained in the engines and upgrades section below) to increase their speeds and capabilities. At the start of each turn, players will be given a new goal until they have a maximum of 3, a new engine up to a maximum of 3 and an upgrade up to a maximum of 4.
